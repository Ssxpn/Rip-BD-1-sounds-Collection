# BD-1 Voice Assistant Project

Welcome to the **BD-1 Voice Assistant Project**!  
This repository aims to create a voice assistant using BD-1â€™s sound library.

![BD-1 Sound Project](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Shcaq2sc_Ovxg0BefIrLsAHaLO?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain)


**Work in Progress:** The database is not yet complete (I still have around 5 hours of audio files to review).

## Project Goal

The objective of this project is to **build an AI-driven assistant** that responds using BD-1â€™s iconic sounds in an emotionally coherent way.  

For example:  
- When the user says *"No"*, BD-1 should sound disappointed.  
- When the user says *"Hello"*, BD-1 should sound happy.

I'll be using and ESP32S3 for this project.

The challenge? **I have no idea how to achieve this yet.**   

However, the BD-1 soundbank contains:  
- **Complete phrases** that could be used directly.  
- **Shorter sounds** that might be combined to form meaningful responses.

## How You Can Contribute

I welcome any help, as Iâ€™m new to this field!   
Here are some key tasks where you can assist:

### **1. Clean & Organize the Sound Database**
- **Remove duplicate sounds** (some clips seem to be repeated).  
- **Rename files** to reflect their emotional intent while keeping the original numbering:  
  Example: `xxxxxx-AngryBeeps.wav`, `xxxxxx-HappyChirp.wav`  
- **Sort files** into directories by emotion (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.).

### **2. AI Emotion Classification**
- Implement a classification system (e.g., using **OpenSmile**) to label each sound with an emotion.  
- Create a mapping where BD-1's responses match user emotions.

### **3. Build the Response System**
- Write the code to **assemble** shorter sounds into meaningful responses.  
- Implement logic to **select** the appropriate BD-1 sound based on user input.

## Tech & Tools

### ðŸ”¹ Proposed Approach:
I plan to use **OpenSmile** to classify BD-1 sounds by emotion.  
Then, a **script** will fetch an appropriate sound from the corresponding emotional category whenever the user expresses an emotion.

**If you have other ideas, feel free to share them!**
