# Rip-BD-1-sounds-Collection
Here is the collection of sounds by BD-1 as used in Jedi Fallen Order

![BD-1 Sound Project](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Shcaq2sc_Ovxg0BefIrLsAHaLO?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain)


**Work in Progress:** The database is not yet complete (I still have around 5 hours of audio files to review).

## How You Can Contribute

I welcome any help, as I’m new to this field!   
Here are some key tasks where you can assist:

### **1. Clean & Organize the Sound Database**
- **Remove duplicate sounds** (some clips seem to be repeated).  
- **Rename files** to reflect their emotional intent while keeping the original numbering:  
  Example: `xxxxxx-AngryBeeps.wav`, `xxxxxx-HappyChirp.wav`  
- **Sort files** into directories by emotion (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.).
